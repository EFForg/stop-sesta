<p>We all rely on online communities to work, socialize, and learn. From the largest social media site to the smallest community message board, online platforms are central to our right to assemble and speak out. <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/fosta-would-be-disaster-online-communities">SESTA and FOSTA would shut some people out of those spaces</a>.</p>

<p>The authors of these bills say that they&#8217;re designed to fight sex trafficking, but the bills wouldn&#8217;t punish traffickers. They would threaten legitimate online speech.</p>

<p>Online platforms are enabled by a special law referred to as CDA 230 or simply Section 230. Section 230 protects online platforms from liability for some types of speech by their users. Without Section 230, social media would not exist in its current form, and neither would the plethora of nonprofit and community-based online groups that serve as crucial outlets for free expression and knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>If Congress undermined these important protections by passing SESTA, many online platforms would be forced to place strong restrictions on their users&#8217; speech, silencing a lot of marginalized voices in the process.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s tell Congress: SESTA and FOSTA wouldn&#8217;t stop sex trafficking, but they <em>would</em> strangle online communities.</p>
